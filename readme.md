<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

These are the instructions for installation and operation

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your machine
- Visual Studio with .Net6.0 or later
- An instance of seaweedfs running with a master, volume, and filer: [How To](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Getting-Started)
- The Filer will have to be running with a security.toml file: [Info](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Security-Overview#jwt-based-access-control)
- The secret(encryption) key used in this application can be viewed and changed in the app.py file
- The timeout of the secret key *has to be the same in app.py and security.toml*
- Both read and write signing_key(s) are recommended

You will need to install the python flask server to log in and authenticate the user:

# Python Server(Authentication API)
in the flask-server folder run:
* pip
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
